Settings for Voyage AI embedding models.

Voyage AI models are CodeWeaver's recommended embedding models. They're high quality, low latency, and cost-effective (first 200M tokens are free).
Our default model is currently `voyage-code-3`, which is optimized for code embeddings.

Voyage's models provide best-in-class performance, and even more interesting, they maintain that performance when heavily quantized. Performance when quantized to binary 256-dimensions still significantly exceeds openai's `text-embedding-3-large` at **1/384th** the storage size (and cost).

We take the unusual approach here of defaulting to output at int8 1024-dimensions, which provides identical performance to float 1024-dimensions, but at 1/4th the storage size and cost. This is a good default for most use cases, but you can change the output dimensions and data type in your profile if you need to.
You can see the [performance comparisons here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5GDXOXueHuBT9demPrL9bz3_LMgajcZs_-GPeawrYk/edit?gid=105010523#gid=105010523).

We think the other models are worth trying out too, because every codebase is different, and you might find that one of the other models works better for your specific use case.
We particularly think `voyage-context-3` is worth trying out. Unlike nearly all other embedding models, it produces embeddings that represent not just the chunk of text you provide, but also *the chunks of text as a whole*.
This means that it can produce embeddings that are more representative of the overall context of the document, rather than just the individual chunks.

Nevertheless, because we use semantic chunking for most code, you're not likely to see a significant difference in performance between `voyage-code-3` and `voyage-context-3` for most codebases.
